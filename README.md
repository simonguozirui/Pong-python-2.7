# Pong-python-2.7
##Created by Simon Guo and Jesse Zhao
It requires [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/) and [Pygame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html) to run.
Please check your python version, make sure it is 2.x.

This was part of my grade 9 computer science class.

Pong is a really famous and original game. In the samples of Pippy on OLPC, there is also a Pong game in the graphics categories. In order to understand python better, we started a project to modify pong through coding in python.
